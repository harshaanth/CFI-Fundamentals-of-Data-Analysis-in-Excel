In this course, I learned about Excelâ€™s built-in tools to organize data into structured spreadsheets and tables, derive insights using pivot tables, and visualize findings by creating dashboards in Excel. The course emphasized modern functionality such as dynamic array formulas, linked data types, and ideas in Excel. I worked hands-on with real-world datasets, including financial statements and retail sales data.
